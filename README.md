Project Title:
Car Rental System

Project Description:
The Car Rental System is a desktop application developed using Python and PyQt5 with SQLite as the backend database. The system allows users to view and book different categories of cars — including sedans, crossovers, and SUVs — through a simple and intuitive graphical interface.
Users can register, log in, and make reservations. The system is designed to streamline the car rental process while providing clear navigation and reliable data handling via a local database (SQLite), which can be later migrated to a more scalable solution.

Project Requirements:
Login System – Secure login functionality using SQLite authentication.

User Registration – Form for new user account creation with field validations.

Main Application Window – Central dashboard to navigate between car categories and features.

Sedan Booking Interface – Display and booking functionality for sedans.

Crossover Booking Interface – Display and booking functionality for crossovers.

SUV Booking Interface – Display and booking functionality for SUVs.

Reservation Form – Collects user info and rental preferences before confirmation.

Confirmation Dialog – Displays confirmation messages after booking.

Database Integration (SQLite) – Stores user accounts, booking records, and car information.

User Feedback UI – Error, success, and information messages shown via message boxes.
